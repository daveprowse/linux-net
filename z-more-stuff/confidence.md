# Be Confident!!

For me, what it all really boils down to is **confidence**. 

Confidence in yourself. Confidence in your ability to adapt to new situations and learn new technologies. 

People often ask: "How do you build confidence?" Well, I suppose a person could write a book about that, and probably has. But to be brief, speaking from my experience, you do it in small blocks. Start with a little task. It could be anything: sending a resume, making a phone call, coding an auto-minimizing terminal window, whatever. Complete it efficiently and then take a small bit of pride in it. Realize that you are now on the path. Add another small block. Repeat. 

Do this continuously over time; that's where the discipline and dedication come in to play. As you do so, your plan will begin to form. 

 As time passes, you will find that your confidence grows; it just kind of happens. But also, in a way, you become confident by simply believing in yourself, believing that you are a confident person. The "self-created legend" so to speak. You create your own confidence by simply saying "I can do this!" 

 And you can.
